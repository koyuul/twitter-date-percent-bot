Hello everyone. This is my first time uploading a code on github, so sorry if I do it wrong. This bot uses Python 3.7.2. 

In order to use this, you need to create a developer twitter account, and make an app, in order to get the proper keys. These keys are used to
take the code output from code to tweet.

Make an account on any website that can run codes at a certain time. I used Python Anywhere (https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
From there, you upload the code as a file, and then have it as a task that runs a certain time every day. 
(Python Anywhere includes an expiring date, which requires you to extend the expiry once every month or so. 

For me, it did not read Python commands at first, so be sure to check that Python Anywhere's console executes the code like your 
compiler does.
